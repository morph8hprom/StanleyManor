Room 1
---------
desc1:
You awake somewhere entirely foreign to you.  Your nostrils are plugged with
dirt and clotted blood, and your scalp feels unnaturally cold.  When you finally
gather yourself and check your surroundings, the first thing you notice is a
large black wooden door behind you.  It seems almost too perfect to exist and
you find it difficult to divert your attention.  Once you finally manage, you
notice a gaping hallway to your right.  The passage seems to be dimly lit with
candles the whole way through and at the end is a plain wooden door.

desc2:
You enter a very dusty room with a large black wooden door and a candle-lit hallway


Room 2
---------
You enter a small cramped closet.  There doesn't seem to be anything in here.


Room 3
---------
You step outside and are immediately faced with a sickly pink sky that stretches
for miles.  A pathway of concrete stones leads into an area surrounded by a tall
iron fence to your left.  To your right is a winding dirt path that leads to a
pond a good ways off.


Room 4
---------
Passing through the arched entrance gate sends a sudden shiver through your
entire body and you involuntarily glance behind you with quickness that you
weren't aware you possessed. In the same instant, you turn to run and fall flat
on your face.  Terror floods your senses as you feel vines creeping along your
ankles, and then up to your calves.  Your screams of horror only last for a
moment before another hulking vine twists itself around your neck and mercilessly
crushes your throat.

Room 5
---------
As you take the first steps over the hill your shoes feel oddly light and you
seem to have found a spring that was not previously present in your step.
On the other side, your are met with a small patch of dasies surrounded by a
border of black stones.
